# Airdrome — project memory

Repo-local, git-tracked memory. Durable *workflow* facts that don't belong in
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) (current-state map), [README.md](../../README.md) (user-facing)
or [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) (forward-looking).

## Worktrees

- A fresh worktree (Orca or plain `git worktree add`) starts **without `.venv` and
  `.env`** — both are gitignored, so nothing carries over from the base checkout. No
  `uv run` command works until you `uv sync` and create `.env` (`DB_DSN`, `LIBRARY_DIR`
  — see README *Configuration*). The repo has no `.orca/worktree-setup.sh`, so this is
  manual per worktree.
- The test suite additionally needs the compose Postgres up (`docker compose up -d`,
  port 5437) — a doc-only change can be made and committed from a worktree without it,
  but any code change must be verified where Docker is reachable.
